README File - ICY Analysis python 
The following codes can be used to analyse and visualise netCDF data of the arctic region

DOWNLOAD_DATA_HTTPS.py
The code can be used to download from any available server, which allows https requests
The code has been developed for the use with the Earthdata Databank of NSIDC but also works for other servers

DATA_VIEW.py
The code can be used to read the netCDF files to look at the varibles. Inside the variables is also the "polar-stereographic" variable which is important to look at, for the correct ,map projection

SEA_ICE_CONCENTRATION_ASMR2_VISUALISIERUNG.py
This script is the main visualisation script. The code is with a lot of explanation, but in German. I will change that soon.

IMAGEIO_VIDEO_VISUALISIERUNG.py
This script can be used to create a video out of the hundreds of png files. 
The animation looks very nice, I think. 

The animation is also online in the same directory 

More details are coming soon.
